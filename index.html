            <h2>What even is a Leprechaun?</h2>
            <p>A leprecahun is a mytholigcal creature identified as a fairy. Leprechauns are known as solitary creatures and most often play mischevious pranks on people. Popular culutre has crafted the image of a leprechaun to be a mischevious shoemaker
                that hides pots of gold at the end of a rainbow. We all can identify leprecahuns as the mascot of the delicious Kellog cereal Lucky Charms, but leprecahus are so much more than that. They are important in Irish folklore although they were
                not often referenced in Irish mythology.

            <h2>Why are leprecahuns important to me?</h2>
            <p> As a junior and senior in high school I worked at a local Irish pub called Dohertys despite not being Irish in the slightest. I spent many of my night listenting to Irish music and being surrounded by various cheesy Irish souvenirs. I worked
                St Paddy's day weekend at the pub and many people came dressed as leprechauns and I spent the entire weekend fully immersed in over the top Irish culture. I even had leprecahun face tattoos on that I was unable to get off for multiple
                days after. Thus leprechauns are near and dear to my heart and I would love to spread awareness about them.

        <p>I would like to clarify that anything written is satire though based on facts and I am not in fact this passionate about leprechauns.
